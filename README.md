# CROW GENERATOR #
There are many starting points for building a new web project, but the main idea of this generator is to be simple and extensible, always creating an easy maintenance scheme.

## Why Crow ##

"Nevermore!" ("Never Again!") Said that bird in the poem "The Raven" ("The Crow"), Edgar Allan Poe. Yes, the raven is able to imitate the sound of a few words, as the parrot. In many legends, the crows are depicted as cheaters.

Crows are able to use simple tools, store food for the winter and store experiences for use in future circumstances. One was observed using the hard leaf of a tree like a knife to fall nuts on a busy street and being crushed by the wheels of cars, facilitating access to seed. Notable, no? They can also recognize people and remember their faces for years.
